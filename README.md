This is the software repository for the Acadia High Altitude Balloon framework. It uses multiple microprocessors to carry out a variety of tasks during the flight of a high altitude balloon.

APRS is intended for use by licensed radio amateurs.




Features
==========

 * Tracking using APRS as well as a landing beacon using LTE
 * Cutdown system to sever connection between parachute and balloon at a preset altitude
 * Utilization of the HQ Raspberry Pi Camera for photographs from high altitude
 * Direwolf libraries are used on the Pi to generate AFSK 1200 baud tones
 * Communication between flight computers using Bluetooth Low Energy


Roadmap
=========

 * Use LoRa 915 MHz radio for other telemetry relaying
 * Add Iridium SBD tracking for further communication capability
